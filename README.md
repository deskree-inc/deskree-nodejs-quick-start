# express-boilerplate
Quick start Express JS template for building Deskree microservices.

## Setup for integrations

In order for the template to run the following things needs to be considered and configured.

### Folder structure

The project has the following directory structure:

```
.
+-- .github - folder to put your GitHub actions
+-- src - source code
|   +-- controllers - API controllers
|      +-- baseController.ts - base controller class that contains express router, error and success response handling
|      +-- postmanController.ts - controller for getting Postman collection. This must be generated by the `npm run postman` command
|   +-- models - models reserved for business logic
|      +-- baseModel.ts - base model class that contains Deskree SDK
|      +-- postmanModel.ts - model for reading the Postman collection
|   +-- app.ts - express app base class
|   +-- index.ts - component responsible for express setup, imports all controllers
|   +-- resError.ts - error class
|   +-- resSuccess.ts - success class
+-- .env.example - environmental variables for local development. Should be copied to .env with the correct values
+-- .eslintignore - eslint ignore file
+-- .gitignore - gitignore file 
+-- .eslintrc - eslint configuration file
+-- package.json - Node packages
+-- README.md - README file
+-- tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration file
```

### Commands

The project has the following directory structure:

```
npm run lint - lint command
npm run clean - rimraf clean
npm run serve - start Express app
npm run postman - generate Postman collection
 ```
 
### Tips on how to get started

1. To start using Deskree SDK, provide your project id as `DESKREE_PROJECT_ID` in your `.env` file. For more information on how to get started, please visit [Deskree SDK](https://docs.deskree.com/javascript-sdk/).
2. Each controller can also contain a Postman collection description data if you want to generate postman collection by running `npm run postman command`. To learn more about the format visit [postman-collection-generator package](https://github.com/deskree-inc/postman-collection-generator).
3. When adding new controllers, make sure to import them in `src/index.ts` file, and add them to the `App` instance inside controllers array. To use `resSuccess` and `resError` classes, make sure to extend your controllers from the base class.
4. If you have any questions on how to use this template, Deskree platform, or have suggestion you would like to share, please visit our community pages on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xzZXQ7GwRh) or [Forum](https://community.deskree.com/).


## .env Structure

The following is the base project `.env` structure. All additional `.env` variables should be added as per integration requirements.
```
APP_BASE_PATH = '/v1'
DESKREE_PROJECT_ID = 'deskree-project-id'
```

* `APP_BASE_PATH` - the base path of the app. You can use it to create API version (ex. `/v1`)
* `DESKREE_PROJECT_ID` - the Deskree project id. You can get it from the Deskree dashboard.
